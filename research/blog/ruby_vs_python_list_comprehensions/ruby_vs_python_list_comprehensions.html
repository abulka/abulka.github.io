    <h1>Python list comprehensions vs. the way Ruby does things</h1>
<p><strong>Intent:</strong> Loop through a list of numbers and pick out the ones greater than 5, and multiply them by 100.  Return them as a list.</p>
<h2>The Python way...</h2>

<code>
    #!/usr/bin/env python
 
# Long explicit way:
result = []
for n in range(1,8):
    if n > 5:
        result.append(n*100)
print result
# result [600, 700]
 
# Concise way:
print [n*100 for n in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] if n > 5]
# result [600, 700]
</code>

And the ruby way...

<code>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
 
# Long explicit way:
result = []
(1...8).each do |n|
    if n > 5
        result << n*100
    end
end
p result
# result [600, 700]
 
# Concise way:
p [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].select{|n| n > 5}.map{|n| n*100}
# result [600, 700]
</code>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Thoughts:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It seems to me that the puzzle (such that it is) consists of two distinct stages.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The first stage is to select items from the list and the second stage is to apply a transformation onto each selected element.  </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">I used to think that the python syntax was superior, but once you get around the idea of the two stages, the ruby syntax makes perfect sense too. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Also, I guess the “select + map idiom” is so common that the special python syntax wins in that it isn’t telling you how anything is being done – the “list comprehension” just reads better.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The ruby version is a little more cryptic to the newcomer I guess and is telling you how everything is being done.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The ruby version on the other hand is more general, and would allow other varieties of select/transform/manipulate to get plugged in, and you can have as many as you like e.g.</span></p>
