    <h1>Thoughts on Closures</h1>
    <p>It seems like closures are all the rage in software development circles.  Ruby and Groovy have them and then C# got them.  Python had a form of them but are they really closures?  What are closures anyway - do we need them?</p>
    <p>In this presentation I argue that anything you can do with closures you can do without closures.  Often not as elegantly, but often just as clearly.  What do you think?</p>
