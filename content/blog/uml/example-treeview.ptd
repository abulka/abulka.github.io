    name: Treeview Example
    version: 1.0
    description: Example of PT (plain text) diagram notation, showing a treeview component for a code editor extension. A Use Case (sequence diagram as text) example showing a Treeview construction code, representing the functionality of my vscode extension [Snippets Explorer](/projects/libraries/snippets-explorer/) which shows vscode source code snippets in a treeview. This sequence 'diagram' example includes features like `[if]`, `[else]` and plenty of psuedo code descriptive text.
    files: snippet_tree.js, snippet_enumerator.js

Use Cases:
  Scenario: Building Snippet Tree
    _buildTree(languageId: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
      Logs the start of tree building for the given language.
      [if languageId is undefined]
        Initializes `this.itemTree` with a placeholder message.
        < number
      [else]
        Initializes `this.snippetTree` and `this.itemTree` as empty structures.
        -> enumerateSnippets(this.snippetTree, languageId) [./snippet_enumerator]
            Populates `this.snippetTree` with snippets for the given language.
            < void
        -> logSnippetTree(languageId: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
            Logs the structure of `this.snippetTree`.
            < void

        Constructs the tree structure:
        - Iterates over `this.snippetTree` to create `TreeItem` instances for each language.
        - For each language, iterates over its snippets to create nested `TreeItem` instances.
        - Sets tooltips, collapsible states, and parent-child relationships.

        Updates `this.itemTree` with the constructed tree structure.
        Stores the tree in `this.languageIdTrees` for the given language.

        Logs the completion of tree building.
        < void
        
  Scenario: Switching Language
    switchLanguage(languageId: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
      Logs the start of language switching.
      [if languageId is not in this.languageIdTrees]
        -> _buildTree(languageId: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
            Builds the snippet tree for the given language.
            < void
      [else]
        Restores `this.snippetTree` and `this.itemTree` from `this.languageIdTrees`.
        -> _restoreExpandedStates(languageId: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
            Restores the expanded states of tree items for the given language.
            < void
        Fires the tree data change event to refresh the UI.
        -> _selectSubtree(languageId: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
          Selects and reveals the subtree for the given language.
          < void
      Logs the completion of language switching.
      < void

  Scenario: Refreshing the Tree
    refresh() [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
      Logs the start of tree refresh.
      -> _buildTree(this._getCurrentDocumentLanguageId()) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
          Rebuilds the snippet tree for the current language.
          < void
      Fires the tree data change event to refresh the UI.
      Logs the completion of tree refresh.
      < void

  Scenario: Filtering Tree Items
    updateFilterQuery(filterQuery: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
      -> _filterItems(items: TreeItem[], filterQuery: string) [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
          filters tree items based on the query
          < TreeItem[]
      -> _onDidChangeTreeData.fire() [class TreeDataProvider, snippet_tree.js]
          fires the tree data change event
          < void
