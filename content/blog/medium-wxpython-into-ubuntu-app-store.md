Have you ever dreamt of getting your own apps in the Ubuntu app store? Here’s how.

I wanted to get my UML tool for Python, Pynsource, into the Ubuntu/Snapcraft app store for a long time. This is the story of how I made that happen.

It certainly wasn’t easy. It took me a week of work, struggling with the concepts, documentation and various bugs in the tooling to finally get my app listed.
Hopefully I can save you some time getting your Python command line app or wxPython GUI app published.
