How I used the Python AST capabilities to build the [Python to Rpn converter](https://pyrpn.atug.com/).

## Python compilation pipeline

My program works at the AST stage of the compilation pipeline:

Specifically my approach has been to use Python's built in ability to parse itself into an AST [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), then to traverse this tree using the visitor design pattern to generate the RPN.  

> The Python AST parser is built into Python and thus requires that you be running Python to use it.

## Example

For example, parsing the following Python code with `ast.parse`:

```python
import ast
import astunparse
print(astunparse.dump(ast.parse('x = 1 + 2')))
```

will generate the following AST data structure representing `x = 1 + 2`

```
Module(body=[Assign(
  targets=[Name(
    id='x',
    ctx=Store())],
  value=BinOp(
    left=Num(n=1),
    op=Add(),
    right=Num(n=2)))])
```

## Reception to the talk

The reception to the talk entitled "Leveraging the Python AST, Pythonâ€™s hidden DOM" was good, but became fun and buoyant once the audience realised I had targeted an old HP calculator !

with this fancy Python technology - especially when I pulled out my HP calculator collection for all to see and touch. ðŸ˜„
