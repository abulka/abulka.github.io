# Thoughts on Closures

It seems like closures are all the rage in software development circles.  Ruby and Groovy have them and then C# got them.  Python had a form of them but are they really closures?  What are closures anyway - do we need them?

In this presentation I argue that anything you can do with closures you can do without closures.  Often not as elegantly, but often just as clearly.  What do you think?

Ah just what I'm looking for! I could not find this operator documented on the Groovy site. Excellent topics too btw, makes my learning idiomatic Groovy way easier. Thanks.
