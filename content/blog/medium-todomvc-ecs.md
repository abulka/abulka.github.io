Building traditional GUIs with the Entity Component System.

Is the [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) any good for building traditional GUIs?

It turns out that the answer is yes! Whilst ECS is most commonly used in building games, it can also be used for building a traditional web “form” style application like TodoMVC. However you will need to radically rethink how models, their data and behaviour is organised.

This is arguably a refreshing, mind-blowing lesson in GUI programming! 🤯😉
