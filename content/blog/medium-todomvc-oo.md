TodoMVC implemented in a classic Object Oriented way.

> TodoMVC is a long standing web project showing how a ToDo app can be built in numerous frameworks. 

The classic Javascript TodoMVC app implemented without a framework, using plain Object Oriented programming + a traditional MVC design pattern. Distinct, mediating Controller objects are the key to this implementation.

Running demo [here](https://abulka.github.io/todomvc-oo/index.html).

See my full article on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@abulka/todomvc-implemented-using-traditional-oo-controllers-and-events-5e4c09f80cd4).

See also [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/1Marc/todomvc-vanillajs-2022) by Marc Grabanski which shows us how to built TodoMVC in vanilla JS in 2022 (no classes are used in this version).
