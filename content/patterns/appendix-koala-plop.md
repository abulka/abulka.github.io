## Andy's Published Design Patterns


The four patterns MGM, RM, TI and Pattern Automation are substantial works which have been presented at KoalaPlop (Asian Pacific Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs) in both 2000 and 2001.  My shepherds (paper peer reviewers) were:

- Jim Coplien (MGM pattern)
- Ali Arsanjani (TI pattern)
- James Noble (RM pattern).  
- (Design Pattern Automation) was not peer reviewed before being presented and published.

These final versions also incorporate comments and reviews from the attendees of KoalaPlop 2000 and 2001.
