## Jupyter Notebook Tools

A way of implementing complex calculators incl. scrolling text area UI widgets within Jupyter & Colaboratory Notebooks. 

### Scrolling Textareas for Jupyter Notebooks

Scrolling Textareas in a Python Jupyter Notebook, allows building a kind of "Calculator Playground".

### Google Colaboratory

A way of implementing UI scrolling regions within Google Colaboratory Notebooks. 
Google Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, is a version of Jupyter Notebooks, and allows you to write and execute Python in your browser.

This [Colab project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_R4DAqhVgfPc4113N5VxHVeUJ9oxDMKM#scrollTo=bz9ue7M7cRPq) is a simpler version of the scrolling text area idea above, and needs to be fleshed out a little more fully to match the native Jupyter notebook functionality above.
