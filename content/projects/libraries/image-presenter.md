## Image Presenter

An image presentation tool, where you can click and zoom into various parts of a single image.

Relevant text notes associated with each sub-area would appear when zoomed in.  Arrow keys/buttons allow you to step through a narrated sequence of zooms, so that you get can be carefully guided through an art image, or diagram.

Two demo prototype versions, using different underlying technologies:

- https://atug.com/image_presenter/zoomooz/

Source code currently unreleased.
