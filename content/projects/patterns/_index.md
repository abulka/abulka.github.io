## Andy's Published Design Patterns


These four papers are substantial works which have been presented at KoalaPlop (Asian Pacific Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs) in both 2000 and 2001.  My shepherds (paper peer reviewers) were:

- Ali Arsanjani (TI pattern)
- James Noble (RM pattern).

These final versions also incorporate comments and reviews from the attendees of KoalaPlop 2000 and 2001.
