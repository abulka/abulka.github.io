## Literate Code Maps

I've invented a diagramming methodology called Literate Code Maps which improve upon some aspects of UML - actually they are quite different and arguably more useful than UML for understanding complex source code projects. I've been using this notation for many years, and it might help you in your projects.

I've also been writing additional articles on Medium instead of my Blog here.
