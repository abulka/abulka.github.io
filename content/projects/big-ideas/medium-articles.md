[Building a deployable Python-Electron App](https://medium.com/@abulka/electron-python-4e8c807bfa5e)

Building a normal, deployable application for Mac or Windows, using Python 3 is hard. There is nothing like Visual Studio or Delphi (remember that?) for Python where you can drag and drop to design a GUI, press a button and get an .exe or .app to give people. Sad. The closest you can get is to follow a long recipe of steps - which I outline here.

Its about how to use Electron as a GUI front end to Python 3. It gets over 1,000 reads a week for some reason, more than any of my other articles.

### TodoMVC implementation articles

Here are my two recent articles implementing the classic Javascript TodoMVC app in various ways. These two articles shows you how to design apps. Its an alternative to using a modern javascript framework like Vue, Angular or React.

*   [ECS](https://medium.com/@abulka/todomvc-implemented-using-a-game-architecture-ecs-88bb86ea5e98) - using a game architecture
