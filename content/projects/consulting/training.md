Addendum:

If you would like me to run a design patterns course or consult on your next software design, please check out my [product](/index.php/products/ "Products") page.  There is also an open source [Python UML tool](http://www.pynsource.com "Pynsource - UML tool for Python") you might be interested in, plus references to products I have developed over the years esp. the worldclass argumentation visualisation software Rationale and bCisive.
