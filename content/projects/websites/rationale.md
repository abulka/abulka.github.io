As CTO of Austhink, I technically managed and helped architect `Rationale` - an argument mapping application, written in C# and .NET.
This was done together with a great team of developers and thinkers incl. the CEO [Tim van Gelder](https://timvangelder.com/about/).

*Rationale - the desktop app*

>Rationale is now available as an online web app at https://www.rationaleonline.com/
>
> ðŸŽ— Disclaimer: The web version of Rationale was developed by another team, using the source code and design of the desktop Rationale as a base.

Also at Austhink, we developed the online debating and argument mapping website the `Hive`.
