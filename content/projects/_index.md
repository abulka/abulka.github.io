My various projects and apps. 

[Pynsource]({{< ref "/projects/apps/pynsource" >}}) is probably my most popular app which runs on all desktop platforms. [Gituml]({{< ref "/projects/websites" >}}) is my most ambitious website - you can create a free account there and play around.

My favourite big idea is [Literate Code Mapping]({{< ref "/projects/big-ideas/lcodemaps" >}}) which is about creating UML-like diagrams which help programmers understand the structure and behaviour of source code.
