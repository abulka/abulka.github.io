## General Software Architecture Consulting

I will work with you to plan your next software project, ensuring you are using the latest practices and technologies.

I oversaw the building of a large software applications and technical teams at Austhink Software (as Chief Technical Officer), Telstra (Python Team Leader) and many other similar leadership roles.

## Rapid 'Staff Onboarding' Service

We will work with your team - hands on, to

*   Oversee the documentation of your critical project creating:

*   An engaging project overview and architecture summary document (five pages).
*   Five key GitUML project diagrams incl. some as [Literate Code Maps](https://abulka.github.io/lcodemaps).
*   Two quality tutorials.

*   Develop **rapid onboarding programs** for new staff that use this documentation, together with traditional onboarding through handovers, working with automated tests etc.
*   Ensure knowledge is captured when staff leave
*   We can audit your project documentation to protect your company IP and to support governance
*   Our consulting pays for itself through increased programmer productivity and the ability to scale projects more rapidly.
