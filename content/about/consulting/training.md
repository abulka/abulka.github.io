Elevate the **effectiveness of your entire programming team** - Andy can deliver his existing or a customised Design Patterns Course to your entire programming team - at your company's premises or via Zoom.

I have delivered training courses across Australia incl. at [The Australian Synchrotron](https://www.ansto.gov.au/research/facilities/australian-synchrotron/overview).

Consulting and Mentoring is also available.  Contact [Andy](mailto:abulka@gmail.com) for availability.

### Overview

This course provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills required to understand and use the fundamental 23 design patterns as outlined in the classic book “Design Patterns”.  Participants will be able to use the vocabulary of patterns to communicate to software engineers in order to design superior, maintainable, cutting edge software.

### Outline

Course Outline

**A brief history of design patterns** - the patterns movement, how the GOF book was created, why a knowledge of design patterns is crucial to today’s software developers. Where did patterns come from, what is the role of Christopher Alexander. Who are the key patterns people around the world. How has Australia been involved in the world patterns conference scene.

**Detailed presentations of 20 design patterns**: including: state, strategy, adapter, mediator, template method, bridge, factory + more. 

*   “**State Pattern”** can get rid of lots of if/else spaghetti code
    
*   “**Strategy Pattern**” can make your application more pluggable. 
    
*   “**Adapter**” is one of the most important fundamental patterns. 
    
*   “**Mediator Pattern**” can reduce coupling between classes and reduce complexity.
    
*   Understanding the “**Template Method Pattern**” requires that you know your object oriented principles and can make your code base more organized. 
    
*   “**Bridge Pattern**” is a little complex but once you have invested in it, allows you to switch implementations with a single switch. 
    
*   The factory patterns (“**Factory Method**” and “**Abstract Factory**”) are core patterns relating to the creation of instances of your classes. 
    

Many more patterns like this are presented during this course.  Also covered are topics like:

*   **How patterns are used together** – most people are surprised when shown how patterns can be combined.  We will look at the notion of “roles” in classes and look at diagramming techniques for showing overlapping patterns in UML diagrams.
*   **Design Pattern Software** - A presentation of a couple of UML design patterns tools for windows including Sparx Enterprise Architect and IBM Rationale Rose.
*   **Discussion** - Current research directions and the future of patterns (both theoretical and tools).  Classic and cutting edge books and ideas are discussed (time permitting).

### Outcome and Benefits

After completing this course, students will know how to:

*   Describe the history of patterns development.
*   Appreciate the benefits of a patterns approach to programming design.
*   Describe the detailed design, purpose and behaviour of 20 of the original GOF design patterns.
*   Communicate with other developers using the language of patterns.
*   Use design patterns to improve the design of new and existing software.
*   Implement various patterns in various programming languages.
*   Combine different patterns so that they work together in a software design
*   Understand some of the design patterns contained in such frameworks as.NET and Java
*   Choose from a variety of UML tools which automate the application of patterns

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should have:

*   An Understanding of object oriented programming techniques
*   Experience with an object-oriented programming language such as Python, Java or C#
*   Some exposure to UML diagramming models.

The 2 day course can only cover 2/3rds of the total material in this sheet.  As such only approximately 12 patterns can be covered, and some topics like architectural patterns, UML automation tools etc cannot be covered.  However attendees can to some extent customize the course content within the time constraints.  

The 3rd day of the course can be delivered at a later stage as a one day “top up” course.

## Addendum:

If you would like me to run a design patterns course or consult on your next software design, please check out my [product](/index.php/products/ "Products") page.  There is also an open source [Python UML tool](http://www.pynsource.com "Pynsource - UML tool for Python") you might be interested in, plus references to products I have developed over the years esp. the worldclass argumentation visualisation software Rationale and bCisive.
