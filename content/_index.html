Hi, my name is Andy Bulka and I am a Python and Nodejs/Electron software developer. 

I've also recently discovered
Flutter, which is likely going to dominate a large part of software development in the future.

This website holds my blog on software development incl. UML and pattern based software development.  These blog entries
are often based on presentations that I have given to live audiences at various programmer enthusiast user groups or
conferences.

<div class="col-12">
	<h1 class="text-center">The Patterns Movement</h1>
</div>

Capturing hard-won software design experience in the form of design patterns and
architectural patterns is a noble cause that everyone can contribute to.  You
can contribute by writing patterns and maybe even coming to a [Plop patterns
conference](http://hillside.net/patterns/). 

Basically when you see a software
development technique a few times, and see that it isn't yet documented - write
it up in Pattern format and give it a name!  A pattern is more than just a "tip"
or technique though - a pattern represents an abstract idea - that can be
implemented in various ways depending on your circumstances.

<p>
	The Patterns Movement is spearheaded by <a href="https://www.hillside.net/plop/2020/">Hillside and the Plop
		conferences</a>, held each year.
</p>

### There are a couple of things I would like to see happen in the patterns world.


<ul>
	<li>
		First, it would be nice if there was a single, authoritative repository of patterns. Yes an attempt has been
		made - a
		catalog book and and various websites - but nothing authoratative.  I'm starting a list of links
		[here](/index.php/blog/central_repository/ "Towards a central repository of Design Patterns").
	</li>
	<li>
		Secondly, it would be nice to have deep design pattern support in UML
		within all our favourite IDE's.  For example Netbeans has it all -
		coding, form design, UML and design pattern support - albiet not as
		integrated as it could be and not as polished as it could be.
		**Update:** Unfortunately Netbeans seems to have dropped UML support in
		recent builds.
	</li>
</ul>

If IDE's are not your cup of tea, then how about this: source code should have comment markers indicating where the
patterns are, so that a reverse engineering tool can visualise not only the UML but also where the patterns are.  My own
UML tool PyNSource will have such a feature - est. June 2011 <i>(turns out this never happened :-)</i>.

Further advancements are arguably executable UML and even the possibility of building software without code.  I muse a
bit about this in my blog entry on [software visualisation](/index.php/blog/visualising_software/ "Visualising
Software") and my paper on [design pattern tools](/index.php/design_patterns/pattern_automation/ "Design Pattern
Automation"). 

First, it would be nice if there was a single, authoritative repository of patterns. Yes an attempt has been made - a
catalog book and and various websites - but nothing authoratative.  I'm starting a list of links
[here](/index.php/blog/central_repository/ "Towards a central repository of Design Patterns").

Patterns at all levels need to be core **visual** building blocks of IDE's, or at the very least, extractable from
source code into some visual UML tool - rather than being design ghosts that float around, implicit, in our source code.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-lightbulb" title="UML Diagramming" %}}
The open source UML diagramming tool for Python code. Visit the [Pynsource website](https://pynsource.com/) for more information.

Also check out [GitUML](https://gituml.com) for a more advanced UML diagramming tool which works with most programming languages.
