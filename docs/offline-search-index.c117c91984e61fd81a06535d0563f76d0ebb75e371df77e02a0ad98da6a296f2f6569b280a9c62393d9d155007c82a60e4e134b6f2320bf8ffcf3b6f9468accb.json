Its like a modern thermal printer version of a ticker tape for tailing log files. It features display font size options, search and filtering. You can also annotate the output with text fragments that you type in - or screenshots that you paste in.\nThe video is 13 minutes long and covers the basic use cases, history of the project etc.\nAs well as physically printing from Free42, the Print42 software can also be used to print HP Prime screenshots (from either the emulator or real HP Prime hardware via the HP connectivity kit).\nOutside the world of calculators, Print42 can be used to ‘tail’ log files (programmers take note) and to print graphic snippets from the web. Useful if you want to rapidly print information to stuff into your pocket or to study and annotate printouts of complex information, at your desk.\nIf you are looking for a useful, fun new gadget, you might want to consider buying an Epson thermal printer and trying Print42. However you can also use Print42 with your regular desktop printer, for free.\nThe website for downloads and further information is www.print42.atug.com\nPython to RPN I am pleased to announce the Python to HP42S RPN converter website is online.\nwww.pyrpn.atug.com You write code in a high level structured language (which happens to be Python 3 syntax), hit a button and RPN is generated. You then paste the RPN into Free42 or transfer it to your DM42 (by creating a raw) - and it runs.\n Examples: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/examples User Guide: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/help Canvas for 42S Simulator: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/canvas List of HP42S Commands Supported Reference: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/cmds  The converter supports core Python syntax (which is very powerful), but does not implement the built in Python libraries that you would get in desktop Python. You have to rely on the ability to call HP42S commands from Python to do your work - which of course you can do. Specifically, it has the following capabilities:\n Variables Functions, Multiple functions, nested functions Parameter passing, receiving return values, multiple return values if elif else Comparison operators == != \u003e \u003c \u003e= \u003c= Booleans True, False and operators not or and for loops, range(), for..in iteration through lists and dictionary keys while loops, while…else continue and break operations in for loops and while loops Lists and Dictionaries (basic operations only). Matrices, Pythonic matrix element access syntax [row,col] NumPy compatible slicing syntax for sub-matrices Complex numbers using either 42S or Python native syntax Expressions involving nested brackets assert Testing and clearing of flags Access most HP42S commands as function calls e.g. FIX(2) Some enhanced functions to make life easier e.g. varmenu() automates and simplifies the generation of MVAR based code.

In contrast - traditional “pointer” and “arraylist” techniques of implementing relationships are fully flexible but often require a reasonable amount of non-trivial code which can be tricky to get working correctly and are almost always a pain to maintain due to the detailed coding and coupling between classes involved, especially when back-pointers are involved.\nUsing a Relationship Manager object to manage the relationships can mitigate these problems and make managing relationships straightforward. It also opens up the possibility of powerful querying of relationships, a very simple version of something like LINQ.\nIn a sense, an Object Database is an elaborate implementation of the Relationship Manager pattern. However the intent of the Relationship Manager pattern is lighter weight, to replace the wirings between objects rather than acting as a huge central database on disk - though persistence is built into Relationship Manager too.\nThe Official Pattern Note this pattern was written and presented in 2001 - quite a while ago! In 2020 the API of the Python Relationship Manager implementation was revised and improved - see full API documentation.\n Download as pdf.\nQuick Example The examples on this page use the modern v2. Python implementation.\nRelationship Manager has also been implemented in Python, C# (.net4 and .net core) and Java - see the Relationship Manager GitHub project for all implementation source code.\nInstallation pip install relationship-manager Usage from relmgr import RelationshipManager rm = RelationshipManager() rm.enforce(\"xtoy\", \"onetoone\", \"directional\") x = object() y = object() rm.add_rel(x, y, \"xtoy\") assert rm.find_target(x, \"xtoy\") == y Benefits  Modelling relationships is easy and consistent Back pointer are free Using a query language (think LINQ) is possible over your objects Optional constraints ensure wrong wirings are not made  Traditional object oriented programmers wire up their objects manually using pointers and arrays, whereas database programmers save their objects in a database and let the database model the relationships.\nProgrammers often use ORM mappers to get the best of both worlds - objects which also have a representation in a database. Relationship Manager is another solution to being able to more easily model and query your objects - without needing a database.\nQueries You can make queries on the Relationship Manager instance:\n# query API def find_targets(self, source, rel_id) -\u003e List: def find_target(self, source, rel_id) -\u003e object: def find_sources(self, target, rel_id) -\u003e List: # Back pointer query def find_source(self, target, rel_id) -\u003e object: # Back pointer query def find_rels(self, source, target) -\u003e List: def is_rel(self, source, target, rel_id=1) -\u003e bool: Constrained Relationships You can enforce relationships. For example enforce() works like this:\nrm.enforce(\"xtoy\", \"onetoone\", \"directional\") The relationship is registered as being one to one and directional, so that e.g. when you add a second relationship between the same two objects the first relationship is automatically removed - ensuring the relationship is always one to one. Alternatively, the implementation could raise an exception (go into the source and change it if this is what you need).\nModelling relationships What methods do I put where when modelling relationships?\nWhat are all the possibilities of relationships between two classes?\nWhen looking at all the possibilities of relationships between two classes, you get\n one to one one to many many to one many to many  Then you have the variations generated by whether the relationships are either\n directional bi-directional  Finally, you have variations of whether you put pointer methods (e.g. set, get, add) on one class or the other, or both.\nFor example, assuming you have a two classes one on the lhs and one on the rhs - you could omit methods on e.g. the rhs. class, or you could go to the other extreme and provide a full range of methods on the rhs. class. I recommend that you use the table of relationship scenarios table to figuring out what methods to put where for each type of classic relationship you want to model. For example, to implement a one to many relationship between two classes X and Y, you would use template 4 or 5 (use the latter if you want bidirectionality)\nNote that some combinatorial possibilities do not make sense and are left out of the table below.  S means singular API - this makes sense for one to one relationships, or the many side (ironically) of one to many relationships. It consists of methods like get, set, clear. P means plural API- this makes sense where you are dealing with collections, a many concept. It consists of methods like add, remove, getall. - means no methods relating to the relationship have been implemented on that class.  Blank cells mean “not applicable”.\n   Scenario # see below directional bi-directional comments      _one to one_\n1 --\u003e 1 _one to one_\n1 \u003c--\u003e 1    #1.

Normally you would use better method names that pertain to your application domain.\n Instead of .addY(y) you might have addOrder(order). Instead of .getX() you might have getCustomer(). Instead of getAllY() you might have .getOrders() etc.  Here is the table:\n Look up the scenario you need to implement on the left, then use the template implementation on the right in your code.

This means you can reliably use a rm.find_target(source=self) call from either side, knowing there is a relationship in both directions.\n  When you create a directional enforcement rule (Scenario 3A) with a call to rm.enforce(\"xy\", \"onetoone\", \"directional\") or leave out this call altogether, you are causing rm to create only the relationships that you ask for. Thus classes on the 'target' side of a relationship cannot call rm.find_target(source=self) to find out who is pointing to them. They can however, thanks to the magic of rm, call rm.find_source() to derive this information.   This means bidirectional relationships never actually need to be used or declared, 😲, since an implicit back-pointer (i.e. a back reference) is always deducible using rm.find_source(), when using a Relationship Manager! In fact a bidirectional relationship creates extra entries in the rm datastructure, and slightly more overhead in performance (maintaining both relationships e.g. in the case of creation and removal).\nHowever you may still want to declare a bidirectional relationship for its semantic value in your particular business logic domain, or for domain modelling accuracy - or even just for your own implementation preferences.

P.S. To run the code you also need the support files found here. View the code below (requires the flash plugin) - showing an implementation of a Composite Pattern, with back pointer - or simply read the pdf directly.\n Backpointers are pointers on the “target end” of a relationship, so that the target object knows who is pointing at it. For example when a Customer places an Order, it might be convenient for any particular order instance to know which customer ordered it. I think you can choose to conceive of the backpointer in a few different ways:\n as an extra, separate relationship or as part of the one bidirectional relationship or merely a convenience method in the implementation in the r.h.s. class  The easiest way of implementing this backpointer without using relationship manager is to follow the Martin Fowler refactoring technique - see Martin Fowler ‘Refactorings’ p. 197 “Change Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional” - this will ensure you get the wiring correct. In this refactoring, you decide which class is the master and which is the slave etc. See the before and after python pdf below for an example of the correct wiring.\nThe way of implementing a backpointer using relationship manager is simply to call the rm.find_source(target=self) method. Since a rm holds all relationships, it can answer lots of questions for free - just like SQL queries to a database.\n Bi-directional relationships A bi-directional relationship between X and Y means both sides have pointers to each other.\nor just\nWithin this seemingly obvious idea are a myriad of nuances:\nWe must distinguish between a relationship that in its domain meaning, goes both ways, and a relationship which goes one way only. And furthermore, implementationally, you can have RM methods on one class only, on the other class only, or on both classes. The meaning of the relationship and the implementation (methods to create and look up those relationships) are two different things!\n As the diagram above shows, one bi-bidirectional relationship is arguably shorthand for two directional relationships.  In fact in the Python rm implementation, when you create a bi-directional enforcement rule (e.g. Scenario 3) with a call to rm.enforce(“xy”, “onetoone”, “bidirectional”) you are actually causing rm to create two relationship entries in the rm. This means you can reliably use a rm.find_target(source=self) call from either side, knowing there is a relationship in both directions.\n The methods you implement on your classes to create and look up relationships can influence your perception of what is pointing to what.  When you put an API (relationship manager methods) on both classes this might seem to imply that you are implementing bi-directionality - however this does not mean that the “semantic relationship” points in both directions. The meaning of the relationship is often in one direction only, and the existence of methods on both classes merely gives you a convenient way of querying the directional relationship that exists.\nA rm, like a database, allows you to ‘cheat’ and find out who is pointing to a class even though that class has no actual pointers implementing ‘am pointed to by’. This is accomplished by using rm.find_source(target=self). But just because a rm let’s you find out this knowledge doesn’t mean there is a official modelling of this back-relationship in your domain.\n Back-pointer relationships are not the same thing as official, semantic relationships.  However you may still want to declare a bidirectional relationship for its semantic value in your particular business logic domain, or for domain modelling accuracy - or even just for your own implementation preferences.\n A bi-directional relationship (pair) can be implemented more efficiently by a single directional relationship together with the magic rm back-pointer lookup call rm.find_source(target=self).  When you create a directional enforcement rule (e.g. Scenario 3A) with a call to rm.enforce(“xy”, “onetoone”, “directional”) or leave out this call altogether, you are causing rm to create only the relationships that you ask for. Thus classes on the ‘target’ side of a relationship cannot call rm.find_target(source=self) to find out who is pointing to them. They can however, thanks to the back-pointer lookup magic of rm, call rm.find_source(target=self) to derive this information.\nThis means bidirectional relationships never actually need to be used or declared, 😲, since an implicit back-pointer (i.e. a back reference) is always deducible using rm.find_source(), when using a Relationship Manager! In fact a bidirectional relationship creates extra entries in the rm datastructure, and slightly more overhead in performance (maintaining both relationships e.g. in the case of creation and removal).\n Name your relationships with direction in mind If you choose to implement relationship related methods on both classes use the same relationship id on both sides.  The same relationship id should be used in both classes e.g. \"xtoy\" (notice the sense of directionality is built into the name of the relationship!). Even though there is an API on both classes allowing each class to find the other class, does not turn the relationship semantics to be bi-directional from the point of view of domain modelling, but only in a convenient implementation sense. Some may frown on this ability of an implementation to cheat and betray the domain model. Perhaps a flag could be set in the rm to disallow use of the back-pointer lookup magic rm.find_source(target=self) of rm,.\nIn the following implementation of a one to many relationship between class X and class Y, notice the same relationship id \"xtoy\" must be used in both classes.\nclass X: def __init__(self): rm.enforce(\"xtoy\", \"onetoone\", \"directional\") def setY(self, y): rm.add_rel(self, y, \"xtoy\") def getY(self): return rm.find_target(self, \"xtoy\") def clearY(self): rm.remove_rel(self, self.getY(), \"xtoy\") class Y: def __init__(self): rm.enforce(\"xtoy\", \"onetoone\", \"directional\") # probably redundant def setX(self, x): rm.add_rel(x, self, \"xtoy\") def getX(self): return rm.find_source(self, \"xtoy\") def clearX(self): rm.remove_rel(self.getX(), self, \"xtoy\") Note that both classes calling rm.enforce is possibly redundant, since its telling the rm the same information - depending on the order of initialisation of your classes.\nExamples Python Example - Observer pattern Here is an example of hiding the use of Relationship Manager, found in the examples folder as relmgr/examples/observer.py - the classic Subject/Observer pattern:\nfrom relmgr import RelationshipManager rm = RelationshipManager() class Observer: @property def subject(self): return rm.find_target(self) @subject.setter def subject(self, _subject): rm.add_rel(self, _subject) def notify(self, subject, notification_type): pass # implementations override this and do something class Subject: def notify_all(self, notification_type: str): observers = rm.find_sources(self) # all things pointing at me for o in observers: o.Notify(self, notification_type) def add_observer(self, observer): rm.add_rel(observer, self) def remove_observer(self, observer): rm.remove_rel(source=observer, target=self) When using the Subject and Observer, you use their methods without realising their functionality has been implemented using rm. See tests/python/examples/test_observer.py in the GitHub project for the unit tests for this code.\nC# Example - modelling Person –\u003e* Order Say you want to model a Person class which has one or more Orders. The Order class needs to have a backpointer - back to the Person owning that order.\nInstead of hand coding and reinventing techniques for doing all the AddOrder() methods and GetOrders() methods etc. using ArrayLists and whatever, we can do it using the relationship manager object instead, which turns out to be simpler and faster and less error prone. The RM (relationship manager) is implemented in this particular example as a static member of the base BO (business object) class. Thus in this situation all business objects will be using the same relationship manager.\n Note that the use of Relationship Manager is hidden, and is a mere implementation detail.\n Here is the c# code to implement the above UML. This code uses the v1 API documented in the Relationship Manager GitHub project:\nusing System; using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using RelationshipManager.Interfaces; using RelationshipManager.Turbo; namespace Example_Person_Order_Console_App { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var jane = new Person(\"Jane\"); var order1 = new Order(\"Boots\"); var order2 = new Order(\"Clothes\"); jane.AddOrder(order1); jane.AddOrder(order2); // test forward pointer wiring  Console.WriteLine(jane + \" has \" + jane.GetOrders().Count + \" orders\"); // test the backpointer wiring  foreach (var order in jane.GetOrders()) { Console.WriteLine(\"The person who ordered \" + order + \" is \" + order.GetPerson()); } Console.WriteLine(\"Done!\"); } ///  /// BO is the base Business Object class which holds a single static reference  /// to a relationship manager.

C# Future Directions A generics version of relationship manager would be cool - that way no casting would be required. Presently all calls to relationship manager return objects or lists of objects - which you have to cast to the specific type you actually have stored. You can see this casting in the above example.\nResources   Python Implementation README and GitHub project.\n  Full Python Relationship Manager API documentation.\n  See original andypatterns page\n  Official Relationship Manager Pattern page incl. academic paper by Andy Bulka (this page).\n  ","excerpt":"Abstract Basically describes a lightweight, in-memory Object Database. …","ref":"/projects/patterns/relationship-manager/","title":"Relationship Manager - Design Pattern"},{"body":"Introduction This article is twenty years old - its ideas are now simplified and clarified at MVCA pattern\nA live demo running in a browser.\nTip for understanding this article: This is arguably the traditional MVC pattern with terminology tweaked and clarified, and updated for ‘modern’ times where Views are no longer manually drawn but are instead off the shelf GUI widgets or DOM elements.\n Mediator == Controller GUI == View  The Pattern  Comments Comments now disabled due to spam.\nPosted on Jan 18th, 2009 Hi Andy,\nI’ve read your article about the MGM Patterns, it’s a great pattern.\nHowever, I have a question, could you please show me.\nLet say I have a Textbox (GUI), a business object with only 1 property Text,\na mediator-view as your pattern defined.\nWhen changing Business.Text, this procedure is called:\nprocedure setText(Value: String); begin FText := Value; NotifyChanges; // \\*\\*\\* notify mediator to change Editbox content end; therefore, mediator is notified:\nprocedure BusinessChanged; begin FGUI.Text := FBusiness.Text; // this makes Editbox OnChange fires end; OnChange event of Editbox:\nprocedure Edit1Change(); begin Mediator := FindMediator(Self) Mediator.Business.Text := TEdit(Self).Text; { \\*\\*\\* This line would call Business.setText and make an infinity loop } end; The only method I’ve thought of is let the Mediator modify FText field of\nBusiness object. But in this way, Busniess and Mediator have to be in a same\nunit. Is there another way to solve this problem?\nThanks for your sharing!\nKarr. C.\nPosted by Andy on Jan 18th, 2009 Thanks for your interest in the MGM pattern. Your assumption in the above code is that the Editbox OnChange fires when you programatically set the FGUI.Text, which would cause the event sequence\ngui changes -\u003e mgm notified -\u003e changes model -\u003e model notifies mgm -\u003e mgm modifies gui -\u003e gui changes and so on, infinitely!! See your lines marked *** highlighted lines above.\nHowever the Editbox OnChange fires only seems to fire when the text is altered by the user in the gui. It does not fire when the edit1.text is changed programatically. So there is no loop.\nI tried it in Delphi 6. Here is a sample delphi app that proves it.\nhttp://www.atug.com/downloads/mgmquickproof01.zip\nIt has a cheaper form of mgm which I just whipped up, in order to demonstrate the point.\nP.S. If the event HAD fired, you could\n  temporarily disable the event by rewiring the event handler to Nil before writing to it programatically, then restoring the event handler again (yuk, but possible. You often have to do this when using mgm with treeviews.)\n  provide a way of setting the model data which does not trigger a notification. Make the private data public. Again, yuk.\n  … anyway thankfully you don’t need to do either of these things since Editbox OnChange does not fire when the edit1.text is changed programatically\nHope this helps.\n-Andy Bulka\nPosted by Anon on Jan 21st, 2009 Here is a nice article on MVP pattern and the differences to MVC.\nResources Old link on andypatterns.com\n","excerpt":"Introduction This article is twenty years old - its ideas are now …","ref":"/projects/patterns/mgm-pattern/","title":"MGM Pattern"},{"body":"Introduction For the original MGM pattern see MGM pattern\nTodoMVC-OO The classic Javascript TodoMVC app implemented without a framework, using plain Object Oriented programming + a traditional MVC design pattern. Distinct, mediating Controller objects are the key to this implementation.\nRunning demo here.\n MVCA Architectural Pattern This project fully implements the TodoMVC specification. It is implemented without a framework, using plain Object Oriented programming + the MVCA architectural design pattern:\nWhilst the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern is commonly and glowingly referred to, implementations can vary widely. Most documentation on MVC, including the official wikipedia article is vague on definitions and details. This TodoMVC-OO project uses the MVCA pattern (formerly the MGM pattern) which is a clear and unambiguous interpretation of MVC, with the following key ideas:\n The View means a modern GUI framework, and therefore is usually already available to be used by the programmer. One or more Controllers mediate between the View and the rest of the Application, listening for GUI events. Nobody else knows about the View. The Model is traditional data, may contain some business logic, and may broadcast events when its attributes change. The Application owns the model(s), holds view state and contains some business logic methods. An Eventing system is needed, traditionally Observer pattern but the stronger decoupling and the proper event objects of the Publisher-Subscriber pattern is preferred.  Thus MVCA simply means “Model View Controller Application” - all four roles are necessary to any implementation.\n The above diagram was generated semi-automatically from Javascript source code residing in GitHub using GitUML. Click here for more diagram detail as a .svg and the ability to zoom.  View this actual diagram 181 on GitUML.  MVCA In Detail Let’s go through the four parts of the MVCA pattern, which is precisely adhered to by this TodoMVC-OO implementation. Actually there is a fifth important part - the eventing system - which glues it all together - let’s look at the Model first.\nModel The Model is traditional, may contain some business logic, and may broadcast events when its attributes change.\nBy traditional, I mean the Model does not know about anything else except perhaps other models. Its the core model of your data, the domain of the what the application is all about. In the case of the Todo application, it is a collection of Todo items, which can be marked completed.\nclass TodoItem { constructor(title, id, completed) { this._title = title == undefined ? \"\" : title; this._completed = completed == undefined ? false : completed; this.id = id == undefined ? util.uuid() : id; // no getter/setter needed  } get title() { return this._title; } set title(v) { this._title = v; this.dirty() } get completed() { return this._completed; } set completed(v) { this._completed = v; this.dirty() } get as_dict() { return { id: this.id, title: this.title, completed: this.completed } } delete() { notify_all(\"deleted todoitem\", this) } dirty() { notify_all(\"modified todoitem\", this, {during_load: false}) } } The Model is usually broken into many smaller interconnected models in an attempt to reflect the real world domain being implemented as software. The Model can be implemented as mere objects in memory or a full-fledged database model, or a ORM mapping between the two. In our case, we have a pure memory model, which gets persisted into local browser storage as JSON.\nYou will find that some ‘model’ concepts are more about how the information is presented in the GUI, thus I recommend these are kept as attributes of the Application class, and referred to as the view state or view model. The attribute filter is an example of such view state. The Application class can also hold collections of models which is what we do in this project:\nclass Application { constructor(config) { this.todos = [] // model collection  this.filter = 'all' // view model, options are: 'all', 'active', 'completed'  ... } The model can be fat or thin - a fat model will have more business logic in the model. A thin model will most business or application logic in the Application class, treating the model as just data structures.\nFinally, the Model needs to participate in the internal eventing system. Whenever an attribute changes it should send out a notification event - this is why most attributes of our TodoItem class are accessed via getter and setter methods. For example setting title or completed will trigger an internal event to whoever may be listening. This internal eventing mechanism is how Controllers know to update the GUI with updated model information.\nView The View means a modern GUI framework, and as such is already available to be used by the programmer. In our case, our modern GUI framework is the browser DOM which you can build in HTML:\n\u003cinput id=\"toggle-all\" class=\"toggle-all\" type=\"checkbox\"\u003e then Controllers use the GUI native eventing system to listen for interesting events\nthis.gui.$toggle_all.on('change', handler) Controller The Controller is the most interesting aspect of MVC.\nIn many software designs, the Controller isn’t necessarily a single thing. A bunch of stray GUI event handler functions are in reality, part of the ‘controller role’. Code that copies data from the model into the GUI/DOM is also part of the Controller role. I feel the challenge of GUI architectures is to tame the role of Controller into some semblance of coherance and symmetric organisation. Which is why MVCA prescribes creating Controller classes.\nIn TodoMVC-OO we have a Controller class ControllerTodoItem and instantiate one per TodoItem model instance. That’s arguably a lot of controller instances, but this approach allows fine grained updating of the DOM. In contrast, the Jquery version of TodoMVC rebuilds the entire todo DOM on each refresh - something that might become inefficient for non-toy apps.\nIn TodoMVC-OO we have a Controller class ControllerHeader for looking after the header part of the GUI and ControllerFooter for looking after the footer area, which is where the filter buttons are and the count of uncompleted todo items is displayed. The number of Controllers you create is up to you: one Controller per GUI element for fine grained updates, a more relaxed approach of one Controller per related group of GUI elements (my preference) or arguably even one Controller for all GUI elements! I go into more academic detail on this topic in my MGM pattern paper.\nBy clearly defining what a mediating Controller is, and organising our app into different sensible controllers, we tame our design and prevent it from turning into spaghetti.\n  View events only talk to Controllers:\n View events (‘gui events’ e.g. via .on('click', ...)) go to one or more Controllers. Controllers update the View, usually in reponse to an ‘internal event’ notification.    The Controller talks to the rest of the system:\n Accesses App view state. Calls App business logic methods. Modifies the Model directly.    The Controller listens for ‘internal events’ broadcast from Model \u0026 App.\n  Whilst that may seem like a lot to understand, its basically saying Controllers talk to the GUI - nobody else does. Controllers then call into the rest of the system to get things done\nImportantly, we must resist putting business logic into the Controller, simply let the controller call the Application to do what needs to be done. The Controller should do the minimal possible work, mediating and translating between the View and the rest of the system (the App + Model).\nApplication The role of the Application is also important and often overlooked/undocumented. The Application owns the Model, and looks after persisting it. The Application can listen for internal Model events.\nWhilst it is fine to wire Controllers directly to model instances, you will also need the Application to hold “view state” e.g. like the state of the active “filter” in this Todo application. The Application is a centralised class, a kind of hub - to hold higher level business logic and more complex model manipulations. The Application class’s functionality can of course be composed of smaller pieces as software grows more complex but a class called Application should always still exist.\nEventing System Eventing is an important consideration in decoupling models from controllers, and to facilitate abstract communication between objects.\nTwo eventing systems should be distinguished:\n GUI native: The native eventing system of the GUI Framework e.g. DOM .on('click', ... Internal: Your choice of an application system wide eventing system e.g. Publish-Subscribe e.g. document.addEventListener(\"hello\", (event) =\u003e { ... })  Both eventing systems are used in the TodoMVC-OO implementation. As you can see in the diagram above, DOM eventing reaches the Controllers, but no further. The remaining eventing is internal.\nHere is a Literate Code Map of the event flow of TodoMVC-OO. Events are reified as coloured objects, each different event gets a different colour. TodoMVC-OO event flow.\n The above diagram was generated semi-automatically from Javascript source code residing in GitHub using GitUML. Click here for more diagram detail as a .svg and the ability to zoom.  View this actual diagram 134 on GitUML.  The eventing pattern depicted here is Publisher-Subscriber where real event objects are ‘broadcast’ into the ether/event bus/system/whatever - allowing any code in the system to subscribe and respond - the point is, the code emitting the event does not have references to receiver object/methods.\nThe Javascript built in Publisher-Subscriber eventing approach is more flexible and powerful than the Observer pattern since the Observer pattern requires observers to know about and subscribe to Subject objects, which is not always possible or convenient. More dicussion on the differences can be found in this article and on Stackoverflow. Thus we use Publisher-Subscriber eventing (event name → object method) rather than the traditional Observer pattern (object → object) approach.\nI used to be a fan of the traditional Observer pattern but in my later years find the Publisher-Subscriber pattern to be simpler and more powerful - plus Publisher-Subscriber is built into Javascript you simply document.addEventListener(\"hello\", (event) =\u003e { ... }) to listen and document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(event_name, { detail: {from: from, data: data } })) to notify all.\nThe Javascript built in Publisher-Subscriber eventing system is used as the internal eventing system of this TodoMVC-OO implementation.\nApplication Bootstrapping To get things running, some bootstrapping code will create an instance of the Application which in turn creates all the Controllers and loads the Model. The bootstrapping in TodoMVC-OO is done in app.js which creates an instance of Application which is defined in application.js.\n(function (window) { let config = {...} new Application(config) })(window); Notice that a config object with a list of callback methods is passed into the Application.\nGiving the Application class knowledge of individual Controller classes and all the GUI view elements they need is arguably contaminating the Application class with too much GUI view and Controller knowledge.\nThe solution I use is to pass the Application a config object which contains a bunch of callbacks. Each callback function will magically create a Controller instance, wired to look after its GUI elements. Each callback function hides, within itself, references to the DOM - which we don’t want the Application to have. In this way, the bootstrapping code and the Controller code are the only parts of the architecture that know about the View specifics (which we want to restrict).\nThus whenever the Application needs to instantiate a Controller (e.g. each time a TodoItem is created) it calls a config callback function. Another example is during bootup - some permanent Controllers need to be created, like the Controller looking after the header area, so the Application calls this.callback_config.cb_header(this) which creates an instance of the ControllerHeader wired to $('.new-todo') and $('.toggle-all'). The Application only needs to know the callback function names and thus remains pure.\nNotice in the config object below that each callback refers to the view through JQuery syntax e.g. $('ul.todo-list') and passes these references into the contructor of the Controller:\nlet config = { // Callback to create the todo item controllers - are added as needed  cb_todo: function (app, todo) { new ControllerTodoItem( app, todo, { $todolist: $('ul.todo-list') } ) }, // Callbacks to create the permanent controllers  cb_header: function (app) { new ControllerHeader( app, { $input: $('.new-todo'), $toggle_all: $('.toggle-all') } ) }, cb_footer: function (app) { new ControllerFooter( app, { $footer: $('footer'), $footer_interactive_area: $('.footer') }) } } Of course the Controller itself will have further references to View DOM elements, however these references should be based on searching within the outer DOM element passed to the Controller - thus achieving some degree of ‘component-isation’ and re-use. For example the same Controller could be used to look after different DOM elements with different element id’s.\nTodoMVC-OO Conclusion This project fully implements the TodoMVC specification and is implemented without a framework, using plain Object Oriented programming + MVCA architectural design pattern, as described above.\nRunning demo here.\nImprovements In this implementation, I notice that footer renders too early rather than right at the end of the initial render. Its just a subtle flash of the footer when the page is initially redrawn, but I’d like to correct this.\n Resources  Official TodoMVC project with other TodoMVC implementations (e.g. Vue, Angular, React etc.) TodoMVC-ECS - My “Entity Component System” implementation of TodoMVC GUI Showdown MVCA another example of an app implemented using the MVCA architecture (Javascript, open source) MGM pattern (older version of MVCA, presented at a Patterns Conference)  Diagramming  GitUML diagramming used for this project Literate Code Mapping diagramming used for this project  Credit Created by Andy Bulka\nNote: This project is not not officially part of the TodoMVC project - as it is does not use a MVC framework library, nor does it meet the criterion of “having a community” around it.

Reproduction for academic, not-for profit purposes permitted provided this text is included.\nDesign Pattern Automation \u0026 UML Tool Support Various UML Tools support design pattern usage. You typically drag and drop patterns onto your workspace and they appear as UML classes. Its a bit more complicated than this, and raises all sorts of interesting issues. Read the pdf (part 1) and then read the powerpoint and watch the video (part 2).\nPart 1 - Early tools and the philosophy of pattern automation  Part 2 - Design Pattern Tools as of 2006 Here are the slides from a talk entitled “Design Pattern support in UML tools - part II” which I gave in October 2006 to the Melbourne Patterns Group, Australia.\n Alternatively, view the above powerpoint on slideshare or download the powerpoint .ppt directly:\nAddendum As part of my Design Pattern Automation - Part 2 talk, I recorded some of that session. Here is a youtube video of how to apply design patterns using IBM’s Rational tool. Apologies about the sound quality - just look at the pictures!\nDemonstration of Patterns in IBM’s Rational tool. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjKClDX2dUU\n","excerpt":"Introduction As design patterns become more mainstream, various IDE’s …","ref":"/projects/patterns/design-pattern-automation/","title":"Design Pattern Automation"},{"body":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/about/featured-background-cabin_hu711514a202e4ee80bf848c5946e20294_385912_960x540_fill_q75_catmullrom_bottom.jpg); } @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) { #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/about/featured-background-cabin_hu711514a202e4ee80bf848c5946e20294_385912_1920x1080_fill_q75_catmullrom_bottom.jpg); } }  About Andy Bulka A sample site using the Docsy Hugo theme.

Basically when you see a software development technique a few times, and see that it isn’t yet documented - write it up in Pattern format and give it a name! A pattern is more than just a “tip” or technique though - a pattern represents an abstract idea - that can be implemented in various ways depending on your circumstances.\nThere are a couple of things I would like to see happen in the patterns world.\nFirst, it would be nice if there was a single, authoritative repository of patterns. Yes an attempt has been made - a catalog book and and various websites - but nothing authoratative. I’m starting a list of links here.\nSecondly, it would be nice to have deep design pattern support in UML within all our favourite IDE’s. For example Netbeans has it all - coding, form design, UML and design pattern support - albiet not as integrated as it could be and not as polished as it could be. Update: Unfortunately Netbeans seems to have dropped UML support in recent builds?\nIf IDE’s are not your cup of tea, then how about this: source code should have comment markers indicating where the patterns are, so that a reverse engineering tool can visualise not only the UML but also where the patterns are. My own UML tool PyNSource will have such a feature - est. June 2011.\nFurther advancements are arguably executable UML and even the possibility of building software without code. I muse a bit about this in my blog entry on software visualisation and my paper on design pattern tools. Patterns at all levels need to be core visual building blocks of IDE’s, or at the very least, extractable from source code into some visual UML tool - rather than being design ghosts that float around, implicit, in our source code.\nFor full site, see http://www.andypatterns.com/\n   ","excerpt":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: …","ref":"/","title":"Goldydocs"},{"body":"Various projects.
