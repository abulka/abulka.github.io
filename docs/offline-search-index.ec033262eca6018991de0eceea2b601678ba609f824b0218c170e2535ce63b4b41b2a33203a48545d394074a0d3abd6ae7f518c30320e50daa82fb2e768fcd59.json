Classes that use a Relationship Manager to implement their relationship properties and methods have a consistent metaphor and trivial implementation code (one line calls). In contrast - traditional “pointer” and “arraylist” techniques of implementing relationships are fully flexible but often require a reasonable amount of non-trivial code which can be tricky to get working correctly and are almost always a pain to maintain due to the detailed coding and coupling between classes involved.\nIntro2 Presented at ….\n","excerpt":"Introduction 1233 Andy’s Published Design Patterns These four papers …","ref":"/blog/2019/01/04/relationship-manager-design-pattern/","title":"Relationship Manager - Design Pattern"},{"body":"1234567890123 Introduction The Transformation Interface is both a design pattern and an architectural pattern.

A word document containing annotated screenshots for each test helped me enormously.\n  an overlap removal use case which became a unit test\n  Layout / persistence format was created for creating layout scenarios\n{'type':'node', 'id':'D25', 'x':6, 'y':7, 'width':159, 'height':106} {'type':'node', 'id':'D13', 'x':6, 'y':119, 'width':119, 'height':73} {'type':'node', 'id':'m1', 'x':170, 'y':9, 'width':139, 'height':92} Unit Testing Brittleness Avoided Loose tests using (e.g. I created a function called ensureYorder() etc) were created so that the tests were not too brittle. Slight variations in position are ignored.\nView this unit test file at the Pynsource GitHub repository tests/test_overlaps1.py. Here is an example unit test:\ndef _LoadScenario3(self): self.g.LoadGraphFromStrings(TEST_GRAPH3) def test3_5InsertedVerticallyTwoPushedDown(self): self._LoadScenario3() # move m1 to the left node = self.g.FindNodeById(\"m1\") node.left, node.top = (6, 4) d97 = self.g.FindNodeById(\"D97\") oldD97pos = (d97.left, d97.top) # assert m1 has been inserted vertically - two pushed down were_all_overlaps_removed = self.overlap_remover.RemoveOverlaps() self.assertTrue(were_all_overlaps_removed) self.assertEqual(2, self.overlap_remover.GetStats()[\"total_overlaps_found\"]) self.assertTrue(self._ensureYorder(\"m1\", \"D25\", \"D13\")) self.assertTrue(self._ensureXorder(\"m1\", \"D97\", \"D98\")) self.assertTrue(self._ensureXorder(\"D25\", \"D97\", \"D98\")) self.assertTrue(self._ensureXorder(\"D13\", \"D97\", \"D98\")) self.assertEqual(oldD97pos, (d97.left, d97.top)) # ensure D97 hasn't been pushed Running the tests:\n  An example test run\n  Having a huge bank of unit tests helped in refactoring, too. Imagine testing all the necessary scenarios by hand!\nThe final Results were pretty good!\n  A UML diagram after overlap removal\n  Design Patterns Used Memento  Memento was used to remember graph layout positions and then compare mementos to see if anything had ‘changed’ and thus drop out of the Spring layout algorithm early Memento was used to save/restore layouts in my test GUI – assigned to keys 0..9  Blackboard Blackboard pattern used to run layout several times and figure out which was the best, cleanest result using multiple criteria. Each run is a ‘snapshot’\nSnapshot 1 [6] LL 0 NN pre rm overlaps 5 LN 0 scale 1.6 bounds 23 (500, 473) \u003c--- Snapshot 2 [4] LL 0 NN pre rm overlaps 5 LN 1 scale 1.4 bounds 30 (570, 537) Snapshot 3 [5] LL 0 NN pre rm overlaps 6 LN 2 scale 2.0 bounds 17 (444, 393) Snapshot 4 [2] LL 0 NN pre rm overlaps 4 LN 2 scale 1.4 bounds 34 (648, 537) Snapshot 5 [3] LL 0 NN pre rm overlaps 5 LN 4 scale 2.0 bounds 21 (427, 508) Snapshot 6 [1] LL 0 NN pre rm overlaps 10 LN 5 scale 2.0 bounds 18 (485, 379) Python goodness helped in this ‘AI’ smartness\ndef sortfunc(d): # this does the thinking! return (d['LL'], d['LN'], d['bounds_area_simple'], -d['scale'], d['NN_pre_OR']) Future  “Line over node” overlap was abandoned as it started to get really complex with a lot of trigonometry and perhaps this area needs a more academic approach Non straight lines and line routing is probably the better direction Adding an understanding of UML semantics is another direction to research, so that e.g. base classes are above derived classes etc.  Overlap Removal Server In 2020 I needed to expose the overlap removal code as an API for javascript to use.\nHere is that small research sub-project https://github.com/abulka/pynsource/tree/master/Research/overlap_removal_server\nResources Code and Links  Overlap removal code is Python, open source Part of my python UML tool PyNSource: Reverse engineer python source code into UML - display UML as Ascii art or PlantUML diagrams in a proper diagramming visual workspace.

Basically when you see a software development technique a few times, and see that it isn’t yet documented - write it up in Pattern format and give it a name! A pattern is more than just a “tip” or technique though - a pattern represents an abstract idea - that can be implemented in various ways depending on your circumstances.\nThere are a couple of things I would like to see happen in the patterns world.\nFirst, it would be nice if there was a single, authoritative repository of patterns. Yes an attempt has been made - a catalog book and and various websites - but nothing authoratative. I’m starting a list of links here.\nSecondly, it would be nice to have deep design pattern support in UML within all our favourite IDE’s. For example Netbeans has it all - coding, form design, UML and design pattern support - albiet not as integrated as it could be and not as polished as it could be. Update: Unfortunately Netbeans seems to have dropped UML support in recent builds?\nIf IDE’s are not your cup of tea, then how about this: source code should have comment markers indicating where the patterns are, so that a reverse engineering tool can visualise not only the UML but also where the patterns are. My own UML tool PyNSource will have such a feature - est. June 2011.\nFurther advancements are arguably executable UML and even the possibility of building software without code. I muse a bit about this in my blog entry on software visualisation and my paper on design pattern tools. Patterns at all levels need to be core visual building blocks of IDE’s, or at the very least, extractable from source code into some visual UML tool - rather than being design ghosts that float around, implicit, in our source code.\nFor full site, see http://www.andypatterns.com/\n   ","excerpt":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: …","ref":"/","title":"Goldydocs"},{"body":"there seems to be built in content? there seems to be built in content? there seems to be built in content?\nWe can add content here which is good\n   Name Age     Bob 27   Alice 23    OLD FRONT PAGE My Design Patterns Relationship Manager Pattern A central mediating class which records all the one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between a group of selected classes.

Its like a modern thermal printer version of a ticker tape for tailing log files. It features display font size options, search and filtering. You can also annotate the output with text fragments that you type in - or screenshots that you paste in.\nThe video is 13 minutes long and covers the basic use cases, history of the project etc.\nAs well as physically printing from Free42, the Print42 software can also be used to print HP Prime screenshots (from either the emulator or real HP Prime hardware via the HP connectivity kit).\nOutside the world of calculators, Print42 can be used to ‘tail’ log files (programmers take note) and to print graphic snippets from the web. Useful if you want to rapidly print information to stuff into your pocket or to study and annotate printouts of complex information, at your desk.\nIf you are looking for a useful, fun new gadget, you might want to consider buying an Epson thermal printer and trying Print42. However you can also use Print42 with your regular desktop printer, for free.\nThe website for downloads and further information is www.print42.atug.com\nPython to RPN I am pleased to announce the Python to HP42S RPN converter website is online.\nwww.pyrpn.atug.com You write code in a high level structured language (which happens to be Python 3 syntax), hit a button and RPN is generated. You then paste the RPN into Free42 or transfer it to your DM42 (by creating a raw) - and it runs.\n Examples: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/examples User Guide: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/help Canvas for 42S Simulator: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/canvas List of HP42S Commands Supported Reference: http://www.pyrpn.atug.com/cmds  The converter supports core Python syntax (which is very powerful), but does not implement the built in Python libraries that you would get in desktop Python. You have to rely on the ability to call HP42S commands from Python to do your work - which of course you can do. Specifically, it has the following capabilities:\n Variables Functions, Multiple functions, nested functions Parameter passing, receiving return values, multiple return values if elif else Comparison operators == != \u003e \u003c \u003e= \u003c= Booleans True, False and operators not or and for loops, range(), for..in iteration through lists and dictionary keys while loops, while…else continue and break operations in for loops and while loops Lists and Dictionaries (basic operations only). Matrices, Pythonic matrix element access syntax [row,col] NumPy compatible slicing syntax for sub-matrices Complex numbers using either 42S or Python native syntax Expressions involving nested brackets assert Testing and clearing of flags Access most HP42S commands as function calls e.g. FIX(2) Some enhanced functions to make life easier e.g. varmenu() automates and simplifies the generation of MVAR based code.
