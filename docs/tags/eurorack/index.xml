      <description>Trigger to Gate Script for EuroPi This script allows you to convert trigger into a gate signal.&#xA;This is a common requirement in Eurorack modular synthesizers, where some modules require a gate signal to trigger an event, rather than a trigger signal.&#xA;See this explanation on the difference between gates and triggers.&#xA;I originally wrote this script because my 2hp MIDI module clock was outputting 6ms triggers, which are too short to inter-operate with most of my Eurorack modules, which require longer gates e.</description>
